# Network Devices


The following network devices are supported 

- Ethernet interface (eth)
- Wireless adapter (wlan)
- Mobile data Modem (ppp)
- Mobile data adapter with build in router
- USB connected Smartphone (USB tethering)  

All devices require a driver in order to be available for RaspAP. 

## List of detected Devices
Under Networking &rarr; Network Devices the list of devices is available with their attributes and assumed adapter type. The adpapter type as well as the device name can be changed.
Incorrect device types might show up for devices, which advertize them to the system as an ethernet (e.g. `eth0`) or usb (e.g. `usb0`) device. This happens for USB connected phones and external routers.  
The only restriction for the name is, that it contains only lowercase letters and numbers. The maximal length is limited to 20 characters. The name is automatically filtered accordingly.

### Fixing the device name
Fixing the name helps to distinguish different devices. This is especially important, if the Access Point device is connected via USB and the automatically assigned name might 
change. This can happen, when devices are plugged in varying order.

## Ethernet Interface
The build in ethernet adapter as well as USB ones are usually detected automatically and no configuration is required.
Devices like USB tethered phones might show up as an ethernet device as well. The same applies to mobile data adpapters, which contain a router. In these cases the 
type can be adjusted in the device list and a name can be assigned to the device. This will have an effect on the display on the dashboard.

## Wireless Network device
The devices are listed usually with the automatically assigned device name prefix wlan(e.g. `wlan0`). If multiple wlan interfaces are used, it can be an advantage to fix the name of the devices in order to avoid changing names for the devices. Rhis might happen, if devices are connected in different order.

Devices will only show up, if a driver is existing in Raspian. If your device does not show up, a device driver is missing. Have a look at the script 
[raspap/raspap-tools/install_wlan_driver_modules.sh](https://github.com/RaspAP/raspap-tools/blob/main/install_raspap_ram_wlan.sh) 
to search for existing driver modules. 

## Mobile Data Modem
Modems or Point-to-Point Protocol (ppp) devices require login data. A PIN number to unlock the SIM card, the Access Point Name (APN) and login data of your mobile network provider. 
These data can be entered under Networking &rarr; Mobile Data Settings.

The data are written to the file `/etc/wvdial.conf`. This configuration file contains the basic configuration to unlock the SIM card and connect
to the network. This has been tested with a Huawei E1550. If your device requires different AT-commands, you need to manually change this configuration. 

For a correctly connected modem, the connection mode, signal quality and network provider will be displayed on the dashboard.

Be aware, that the name of modems can not be changed. The reason is, that the device name `ppp0` is directly coupled with the required system services.

### Your modem device does not show up? 
In this case its not recognized by Raspian, or it has not been switched into modem mode by [usb_modeswitch](https://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/). Check the log file (`journalctl`) for problems with the device. 

## Mobile Data Adapter with build in Router
Mobile data USB devices, which provide router functionality will usually show up as a ethernet device (e.g. `eth1`). This implies, that the device has to be pre-configured
to work without a PIN for the SIM card and without login data, This usually can be done via the browser based administration interface on any computer.

### Huawei Hilink Device
A special case are Huawei Hilink devices (e.g. Huawei E3372h-320). RaspAP can communicate directly with these devices. Only the administration interface should not be locked with a user/password. The PIN number entered under Networking &rarr; Mobile Data Settings will be used to unlock the SIM card. In addition connection information (mode, signal quality and network provider) are extracted from the device and displayed on the dashboard. The dashboard button to stop/start the device is active and will disconnect/connect with the mobile network.

The model E3372h-320 will be detected as a Hilink device and shows up with the name `hilink0`. Other Hilink devices require a corresponding assignment 
under Networking &rarr; Network Devices.

## Phone - USB Tethering
A phone connected via USB and with enabled USB tethering, will show up as either a ethernet device (e.g. `eth1`), or as an USB network device `usb0`. Changing the device type to phone will lead to a corresponding display on the dashboard. In this case the default name is `phone0`.

## Configuration files
- All device specific settings are stored as UDEV rules in the file `/etc/udev/rules.d/80-raspap-net-devices.rules`.
- The templates for the UDEV rules are stored in `/etc/raspap/networking/client_udev_prototypes.json`. This file contains the list of recognized device types.
- Mobile data settings are stored in: `/etc/raspap/networking/mobiledata.ini`
- Modem AT-commands and login data are stored in: `/etc/wvdial.conf`
