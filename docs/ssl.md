## Overview
HTTPS prevents network attackers from observing or injecting page contents. This is desirable for server applications like RaspAP &#151; or indeed any locally hosted web application. But HTTPS requires [TLS certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), and while deploying public websites is largely a solved issue thanks to the ACME protocol and Let's Encrypt, local web servers still mostly use HTTP because no one can get a universally valid certificate for localhost.

## Locally trusted certificates 
Managing your own Certificate Authority (CA) is the best solution, but this usually requires an involved manual setup routine. An excellent solution for local websites is [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert). This is a zero-config tool for making locally-trusted certificates with any name you like. `mkcert` automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store and generates locally-trusted certificates. It also works perfectly well with RaspAP. This allows you to generate a trusted certificate for a hostname (for example, `raspap.local`) or IP address because it only works for you. 

![raspap.local](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/229399/228976581-34beed42-9f08-4ece-9c1b-e5a865415dab.png){: style="width:450px"}

Here's the twist: it doesn't generate self-signed certificates, but certificates signed by your own private CA. This tool does not automatically configure servers or mobile clients to use the certificates though. There are some steps for macOS and Windows are covered in the [Client Configuration](#client-configuration) section below.

Read more about mkcert [here](https://blog.filippo.io/mkcert-valid-https-certificates-for-localhost/) and [follow the project on GitHub](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

## Creating a certificate
There are two options to go about creating a self-signed certificate with mkcert: 1) manually, or 2) with the 'Quick Installer'. Both methods are described below.

=== "Manual steps"

    Follow the steps below to generate and install a locally-trusted certificate for RaspAP. The local domain `raspap.local` is used in the examples below. You may substitute this with the default `raspberrypi.local` or your own hostname. 

    !!! tip "Tip"
        If you've changed your hostname prior to starting this process, be sure to reboot your device for the change to take effect.

    Start by installing the pre-built binary for Arch Linux ARM on your Raspberry Pi:
    ```
    sudo wget https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/download/v1.3.0/mkcert-v1.3.0-linux-arm -O /usr/local/bin/mkcert
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mkcert
    mkcert -install
    ```
    You should see output like the following:
    ```
    Using the local CA at "/home/pi/.local/share/mkcert" ‚ú®
    The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
    ```
    Generate a certificate for `raspap.local`:
    ```
    cd /home/pi
    mkcert raspap.local "*.raspap.local" raspap.local
    ```
    You should see output like the following:
    ```
    Using the local CA at "/home/pi/.local/share/mkcert" ‚ú®

    Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
    - "raspap.local"
    - "*.raspap.local"
    - "raspap.local"

    Reminder: X.509 wildcards only go one level deep, so this won't match a.b.raspap.local ‚ÑπÔ∏è
    The certificate is at "./raspap.local+2.pem" and the key at "./raspap.local+2-key.pem" ‚úÖ
    ```
    Next, combine the private key and certificate:
    ```
    cat raspap.local+2-key.pem raspap.local+2.pem > raspap.local.pem
    ```
    Create a directory for the combined `.pem` file in lighttpd:
    ```
    sudo mkdir /etc/lighttpd/ssl
    ```
    Set permissions and move the `.pem` file:
    ```
    chmod 400 /home/pi/raspap.local.pem
    sudo mv /home/pi/raspap.local.pem /etc/lighttpd/ssl
    ```
    Edit the lighttpd configuration with `sudo nano /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf`. Add the following block to enable SSL with your new certificate:

    ```
    server.modules += ("mod_openssl")
    $SERVER["socket"] == ":443" {
      ssl.engine = "enable"
      ssl.pemfile = "/etc/lighttpd/ssl/raspap.local.pem"
      ssl.ca-file = "/home/pi/.local/share/mkcert/rootCA.pem"
      server.name = "raspap.local"
      server.document-root = "/var/www/html"
    }
    ```

    Optionally, you can redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS like so:
    ```
    $SERVER["socket"] == ":80" {
      $HTTP["host"] =~ "(.*)" {
        url.redirect = ( "^/(.*)" => "https://%1/$1" )
      }
    }
    ```
    Save your changes and quit out of the editor with ++ctrl+x++ followed by ++y++ and finally ++enter++.

    Restart the lighttpd service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
    ```
    Verify that lighttpd has restarted without errors:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status lighttpd
    ```
    You should see a response like the following:
    ```

    ```
    Now, copy `rootCA.pem` to your lighttpd web root:
    ```
    sudo cp /home/pi/.local/share/mkcert/rootCA.pem /var/www/html
    ```

    !!! warning "Important"
        **Do not** share the private key file (default name is `rootCA-key.pem`).

    Finish by following the [client configuration](#client-configuration) steps below.

=== "Quick installer"

    The [Quick Installer](quick.md) may also be used to generate SSL certs with `mkcert`. The installer automates the manual steps described above, including configuring lighttpd with SSL support. It's recommended to review these steps to have an idea of what is happening behind the scenes. 

    Invoke the Quick installer and specify the `-c` or `--cert` option, like so:

    ```
    curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash -s -- --cert
    ```

    !!! note "Note"
        Executing the Quick installer only installs `mkcert` and generates an SSL certificate with the input you provide. It does _not_ (re)install RaspAP. 

    ```
    $ curl -sL https://install.raspap.com | bash -s -- --cert


    888888ba                              .d888888   888888ba
    88     8b                            d8     88   88     8b
    a88aaaa8P' .d8888b. .d8888b. 88d888b. 88aaaaa88a a88aaaa8P
    88    8b. 88    88 Y8ooooo. 88    88 88     88   88
    88     88 88.  .88       88 88.  .88 88     88   88
    dP     dP  88888P8  88888P  88Y888P  88     88   dP

                                dP      version 3.2.1

    The Quick Installer will guide you through a few easy steps

    ```

    The installer will guide you through the steps of creating a certificate, as shown above. Complete the installation by following the [client configuration](#client-configuration) steps below.

---

## Client configuration
Download the root certificate to your client and add it to your system keychain. This can be achieved via one of the follwing methods:  

1. Copying the file `/home/<user>/.local/share/mkcert/rootCA.pem` (replacing `<user>` with the user you logged into via SSH) to your client via SSH or SFTP from the router
  a. This can also be achieved by just running `cat /home/<user>/.local/share/mkcert/rootCA.pem` and copying the file contents into a new file on your client system; or
2. Simply open a browser and enter the following address, (substituting the domain name you chose in the steps above if different): `http://raspap.local/rootCA.pem`.

??? note "Note for Method #2 (click to expand/collapse)"
    In versions 3.4.0 and prior, you will need to modify the `/etc/lighttpd/conf-available/50-raspap-router.conf` file to allow it to be downloaded by a browser:
    ```bash
    pi@pirouter:~ $ sudo cat /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/50-raspap-router.conf
    server.modules += (
            "mod_rewrite",
    )

    $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/(?!(dist|app|ajax|config)).*" {
        url.rewrite-once = ( "^/(.*?)(\?.+)?$"=>"/index.php/$1$2" )
        server.error-handler-404 = "/index.php"
    }
    ```

    After (note the changed line with the addition of `|rootCA\.pem`: `$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/(?!(dist|app|ajax|config|rootCA\.pem)).*" {`)
    ```bash
    pi@pirouter:~ $ sudo cat /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/50-raspap-router.conf
    server.modules += (
            "mod_rewrite",
    )

    $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/(?!(dist|app|ajax|config|rootCA\.pem)).*" {
        url.rewrite-once = ( "^/(.*?)(\?.+)?$"=>"/index.php/$1$2" )
        server.error-handler-404 = "/index.php"
    } 
    ```
    Restart the lighttpd service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
    ```
    Verify that lighttpd has restarted without errors:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status lighttpd
    ```
    You should see a response like the following:
    ```
