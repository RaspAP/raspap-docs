# Multiple APs

## Overview
:octicons-beaker-24: Experimental

Many users have asked if it's possible to create a second wireless access point on the same device. The answer is "yes" with an AP-capable external wireless adapter and the correct settings.
The [Edimax EW-7811Un USB adapter](https://www.edimax.com/edimax/merchandise/merchandise_detail/data/edimax/us/wireless_adapters_n150/ew-7811un/) works without additional drivers on many devices, including the Raspberry Pi. For this reason it is used in this walkthrough.

!!! tip Tip
    We strongly recommend [this resource](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi) which lists USB WiFi adapters with in-kernel Linux drivers. These will work out of the box on Debian-based devices without installing third-party drivers. You may also wish to skip directly to this [short list](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi/blob/main/home/The_Short_List.md) of "superstar" USB WiFi adapters for Linux. Pay special attention to those that are excellent choices for 5 GHz AP mode, if this is desired.


## Scenario
In this setup, we will use an external Edimax 2.4GHz USB adapter together with the onboard wireless chipset of the Raspberry Pi 4 operating on the 5GHz band. The end result is displayed in the WiFi network scan below.

It is not currently possible to create this setup with RaspAP's UI, so these manual steps are provided below. We can, however, leverage the web UI to create the `hostapd` configurations we'll need.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have followed the [Quick start](index.md#quick-start) or [manual installation](manual.md) instructions.
If an **802.11 AC 5GHz** wireless mode is desired with the RPi's onboard chipset, you must first configure a country that permits wireless operation on the 5GHz band. Refer to [this FAQ](faq.md#80211ac) for more information.

## Create the hostapd configs
The simplest method to achieve this is to use RaspAP's **Hotspot > Basic** tab to create the base configurations. Configure an AP for the onboard `wlan0` interface with the settings shown below. Choose **Save settings** to write this to the filesystem. 

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/229399/121924564-5011ae80-cd3c-11eb-81c8-114972d1a05b.png){: style="width:420px"}

Open your preferred terminal program and enter the following command to copy this as a new `wlan0` configuration:

```
sudo cp /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf /etc/hostapd/wlan0.conf
```

Next, configure a second AP for the external `wlan1` interface with the settings shown below. Again, choose **Save settings** to write this to the filesystem.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/229399/121924637-63247e80-cd3c-11eb-94b1-bf4e1f848fd3.png){: style="width:420px"}

Enter the following command to copy this as a new `wlan1` configuration:

```
sudo cp /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf /etc/hostapd/wlan1.conf
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    If you decide to create two APs on the same band, for example 802.11n 2.4GHz, be sure to select two different channels for each interface.

## Configure dnsmasq
RaspAP's [default settings](defaults.md) includes a preconfigured `wlan0` file for the `dnsmasq` service. Execute `cat /etc/dnsmasq.d/090_wlan0.conf` to display its contents:

```
# RaspAP wlan0 configuration
interface=wlan0
domain-needed
dhcp-range=10.3.141.50,10.3.141.254,255.255.255.0,12h
```

Next, we will copy this file and make some modfications to it:

```
sudo cp /etc/dnsmasq.d/090_wlan0.conf /etc/dnsmasq.d/090_wlan1.conf
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.d/090_wlan1.conf
```

Edit this file so it looks like the example below, then save it and exit your editor.

```
# RaspAP wlan1 configuration
interface=wlan1
domain-needed
dhcp-range=10.4.141.50,10.4.141.254,255.255.255.0,12h
```

## Configure dhcpcd
Similar to `dnsmasq`, the `dhcpcd` service is preconfigured with RaspAP's [default settings](defaults.md). Open this file in an editor by executing `sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf`, then add a `wlan1` block to the end of the file:

```
# RaspAP default configuration
hostname
clientid
persistent
option rapid_commit
option domain_name_servers, domain_name, domain_search, host_name
option classless_static_routes
option ntp_servers
require dhcp_server_identifier
slaac private
nohook lookup-hostname

# RaspAP wlan0 configuration
interface wlan0
static ip_address=10.3.141.1/24
static routers=10.3.141.1
static domain_name_server=9.9.9.9 1.1.1.1

# RaspAP wlan1 configuration
interface wlan1
static ip_address=10.4.141.1/24
static routers=10.4.141.1
static domain_name_server=9.9.9.9 1.1.1.1
```

!!! note "Note"
    RaspAP only manipulates `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf` so your custom hostapd configs won't be touched. The [version 2.6](https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/releases/tag/2.6-beta) release lets you manage the `dhcpcd` and `dnsmasq` configs from the UI, while also preserving any manual changes.

Finally, enable the **Log DHCP requests** toggle on RaspAP's **DHCP Server > Logging** tab. Be sure to restart the `dnsmasq` service. 
## Starting the hotspots
Ensure that `hostapd` is not already running before proceeding. You may stop the service with `sudo systemctl stop hostapd.service` or by using the **Stop hotspot** button in RaspAP's UI.
Now we are ready to run `hostapd` interactively with the configurations we've created above. The debug switch `-dd` is optional but useful for troubleshooting:

```
sudo hostapd -dd /etc/hostapd/wlan0.conf /etc/hostapd/wlan1.conf
```

Connect clients to each AP and monitor the output. You may stop `hostapd` from the terminal with the ++ctrl+c++ keystroke. Alternatively, you may send the process to the background with ++ctrl+z++ and restore it to the foreground with `fg`.

## Troubleshooting
With RaspAP's DHCP logging option enabled, it can be useful to monitor this service's activity from the terminal. Execute `tail -f /tmp/dnsmasq.log` and try associating and disconnecting client devices from each AP.
